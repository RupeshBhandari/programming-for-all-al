# Chapter 3: First Steps with AL
## Your First AL Project
Begin by creating a simple AL project that includes a table, a page, and a codeunit. This project will help you understand the basic structure and syntax of AL.

## Basic Syntax and Structure
AL syntax is similar to other modern programming languages, with clear structures for defining tables, pages, and business logic. Key elements include:

- Table Objects: Define data structures.
- Page Objects: Define user interfaces.
- Codeunit Objects: Define business logic and procedures.

## Running and Debugging AL Code in Business Central
To run your AL code:

1. Publish the Extension: Use the F5 key in Visual Studio Code to build and publish your extension to the Business Central sandbox.
2. Test the Functionality: Access Business Central to verify that your extension works as expected.
3. Debug the Code: Use the built-in debugger in Visual Studio Code to set breakpoints and inspect variables during execution.
